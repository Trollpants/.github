# Trollpants Game Studio
Trollpants was an independent mobile games studio founded in Oslo, Norway on June 30th, 2014. There was 9 founding members that had all just graduated from university with various video games related bachelor's degrees. During the first year of operations, five mobile games and [one Unity plugin](https://github.com/CloudOnce) was released. Due to financial struggles the team decided to break up in the summer of 2015. The studio continued to exist for a little over a year after that, as the Unity plugin [CloudOnce](https://github.com/CloudOnce) was still making some money on the Unity Asset Store. The studio was fully shut down on October 19th, 2016.

To preserve the games, they have all been made open source and updated to run in Unity 2017.3. Hopefully this can also help other indie developers who are just getting started.

The source has been cleaned up and premium third party dependencies have been removed. All IAP and ads have also been removed.

## WebGL builds
So you can easily try each game out, they are all available to play in your browser [here](https://trollpants.github.io/). Be aware that there are some audio issues on some browsers. Also, these builds have not been thoroughly tested, so don't be too surprised if they crash. If you want to enjoy the games in the way they were meant to be played, you'll need to build them to your phone from [Unity](http://unity.com/).
